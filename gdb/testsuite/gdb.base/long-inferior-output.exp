# When debugging with "target remote |", the inferior's output is
# connected to a pipe, and if GDB doesn't flush the pipe while the
# inferior is running and the pipe becomes full, then the inferior
# deadlocks:
#
#  1. User sets breakpoint, and types "continue"
#
#  2. Inferior prints to stdout/stderr before reaching breakpoint
#     location.
#
#  3. The output pipe becomes full, so the inferior blocks forever in
#     the printf/write call.
#
#  4. The breakpoint is never reached.
